@chapter Synopsis

The generic syntax is:

@example
@c man begin SYNOPSIS
ffprobe [options] [@file{input_file}]
@c man end
@end example

@chapter Description
@c man begin DESCRIPTION

ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in
human- and machine-readable fashion.

For example it can be used to check the format of the container used
by a multimedia stream and the format and type of each media stream
contained in it.

If a filename is specified in input, ffprobe will try to open and
probe the file content. If the file cannot be opened or recognized as
a multimedia file, a positive exit code is returned.

ffprobe may be employed both as a standalone application or in
combination with a textual filter, which may perform more
sophisticated processing, e.g. statistical processing or plotting.

Options are used to list some of the formats supported by ffprobe or
for specifying which information to display, and for setting how
ffprobe will show it.

ffprobe output is designed to be easily parsable by a textual filter,
and consists of one or more sections of a form defined by the selected
writer, which is specified by the @option{print_format} option.

Metadata tags stored in the container or in the streams are recognized
and printed in the corresponding "FORMAT" or "STREAM" section.

@section Main options

@table @option

@item -f @var{format}
Force format to use.

@item -unit
Show the unit of the displayed values.

@item -prefix

@item -byte_binary_prefix
Force the use of binary prefixes for byte values.

@item -sexagesimal
Use sexagesimal format HH:MM:SS.MICROSECONDS for time values.

@item -pretty
Prettify the format of the displayed values, it corresponds to the
options "-unit -prefix -byte_binary_prefix -sexagesimal".

@item -print_format @var{writer_name}[=@var{writer_options}]
Set the output printing format.

@var{writer_name} specifies the name of the writer, and
@var{writer_options} specifies the options to be passed to the writer.

For example for printing the output in JSON format, specify:
@example
-print_format json
@end example

For more details on the available output printing formats, see the
Writers section below.

@item -show_format
Show information about the container format of the input multimedia
stream.

All the container format information is printed within a section with
name "FORMAT".

@item -show_packets
Show information about each packet contained in the input multimedia
stream.

The information for each single packet is printed within a dedicated
section with name "PACKET".

@item -show_streams

@chapter Writers
@c man begin WRITERS

A writer defines the output format adopted by @file{ffprobe}, and will be
used for printing all the parts of the output.

A writer may accept one or more arguments, which specify the options to
adopt.

A description of the currently available writers follows.

@section default
Default format.

Print each section in the form:
@example
[SECTION]
key1=val1
...
keyN=valN
[/SECTION]
@end example

Metadata tags are printed as a line in the corresponding FORMAT or
STREAM section, and are prefixed by the string "TAG:".

@section json
JSON based format.

Each section is printed using JSON notation.

For more information about JSON, see @url{http://www.json.org/}.
